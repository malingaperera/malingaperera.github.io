abstract = {Effective physical database design tuning requires selection of several physical design structures (PDS), such as indices and materialised views, whose combination influences overall system performance in a non-linear manner. While the simplicity of combining the results of iterative searches for individual PDSs may be appealing, such a greedy approach may yield vastly suboptimal results compared to an integrated search. We propose a new self-driving approach (HMAB) based on hierarchical multi-armed bandit learners, which can work in an integrated space of multiple PDS while avoiding the full cost of combinatorial search. HMAB eschews the optimiser cost misestimates by direct performance observations through a strategic exploration, while carefully leveraging its knowledge to prune the less useful exploration paths. As an added advantage, HMAB comes with a provable guarantee on its expected performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first learned system to tune both indices and materialised views in an integrated manner. We find that our solution enjoys superior empirical performance relative to state-of-the-art commercial physical database design tools that search over the integrated space of materialised views and indices. Specifically, HMAB achieves up to 96\% performance gain over a state-of-the-art commercial physical database design tool when running industrial benchmarks.},

  abstract={Automating physical database design has remained a long-term interest in database research due to substantial performance gains afforded by optimised structures. Despite significant progress, a majority of today's commercial solutions are highly manual, requiring offline invocation by database administrators (DBAs). This status quo is untenable: identifying representative static workloads is no longer realistic; and physical design tools remain susceptible to the query optimiser's cost misestimates. Furthermore, modern application environments like hybrid transactional and analytical processing (HTAP) systems render analytical modelling next to impossible. We propose a self-driving approach to online index selection that does not depend on the DBA and query optimiser, and instead learns the benefits of viable structures through strategic exploration and direct performance observation. We view the problem as one of sequential decision making under uncertainty, specifically within the bandit learning setting. Multi-armed bandits balance exploration and exploitation to provably guarantee average performance that converges to policies that are optimal with perfect hindsight. Our comprehensive empirical evaluation against a state-of-the-art commercial tuning tool demonstrates up to 75% speed-up in analytical processing environments and 59% speed-up in HTAP environments. Lastly, our bandit framework outperforms a Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS)-based database optimiser, providing up to 24% speed-up.},

  abstract={Automating physical database design has remained a long-term interest in database research due to substantial performance gains afforded by optimised structures. Despite significant progress, a majority of today's commercial solutions are highly manual, requiring offline invocation by database administrators (DBAs) who are expected to identify and supply representative training workloads. Even the latest advancements like query stores provide only limited support for dynamic environments.

Multi-armed bandits balance exploration and exploitation to provably guarantee average performance that converges to policies that are optimal with perfect hindsight. Our simplified bandit framework outperforms deep reinforcement learning (RL) in terms of convergence speed and performance volatility. Comprehensive empirical results demonstrate up to 75% speed-up on shifting and ad-hoc workloads and 28% speed-up on static workloads compared against a state-of-the-art commercial tuning tool and up to 58% speed-up against the deep RL alternatives.},

  abstract={Multi-armed bandits achieve excellent long-term performance in practice and sublinear cumulative regret in theory. However a real-world limitation of bandit learning is poor performance in early rounds due to the need for exploration– a phenomenon known as the cold-start problem. While this limitation may be necessary in the classical stochastic setting, in practice where “pre-training” data or knowledge is available, it is natural to attempt to “warm start” bandit learners. This paper provides a theoretical treatment of warm-start contextual bandit learning, adopting Linear Thompson Sampling as a principled framework for flexibly transferring domain knowledge as might be captured by bandit learning in a prior related task, a supervised pre-trained Bayesian posterior, or domain expert knowledge. Under standard conditions we prove a general regret bound. We then apply our warm-start algorithmic technique to other common bandit learners, the ϵ-greedy and upper-confidence bound contextual learners. Our suite of warm-start learners are evaluated in experiments with both artificial and real-world datasets, including a motivating task of tuning a commercial database.},
