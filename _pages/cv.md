description: Iâ€™m a Software Engineer at Amazon Web Services. I completed my PhD at the University of Melbourne researching the applicability of bandit learning algorithms for physical database design tuning. Before that I have worked in the industry for over four years in data and analytics, in which I have designed several award-winning data tools and platforms. Outside work, I like to work in community-driven organisations and have led many of them to success. In addition, I enjoy public speaking, playing board games and participating in coding competitions. You can download my CV from here.
