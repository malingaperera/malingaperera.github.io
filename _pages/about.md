Finding solutions to hard problems is one of my hobbies, since childhood. This led me towards being an engineer and researcher. I chose computer science and engineering as my career path, due to the growing impact it has on everyone. My life goal is to be in a place, where my code, my research, and my problem-solving skills make a positive impact on a large population around the world.

Having my school education from **Maris Stella College**, I was selected to the **University of Moratuwa** with the *best A/L results in my school*. I was able to be the *batch 5th in the first-year field-selection examination* at the University of Moratuwa, competing with over 700 best minds in Sri Lanka. I chose **Computer Science and Engineering**, to fulfil my dream to be a part of the digital disruption happening all around the globe. I *completed my PhD* on "Use of Reinforcement Learning in Self-tuning Database Physical Design Structures under Dynamic and Unexplored Workloads" from the **University of Melbourne**.

I completed my industrial training in **WSO2 Lanka (Pvt) Ltd** (9 months). I worked in **Sysco Labs, Sri Lanka** as a member of the data team for around 4.5 years. In Sysco Labs, I was able to lead the Database Engineering team to build multiple large-scale big-data systems. Among them, the Cake Data platform won the 1st runner-up in the *‘Best Technology or Framework Innovation’* at SLASSCOM Innovation Awards 2019. Currently, I work as a Software Engineer, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**.

I'm passionate about public speaking. I started public speaking from the days I was at the University of Moratuwa, through the Gavel Club of the University of Moratuwa. I Joined Negombo Toastmasters Club in December 2015 and then Sysco Lab's Toastmasters. I have won many speaking competitions and held various positions (VP Education, VP Public Relations, etc.) on the executive committee. At the University of Melbourne, I worked as the Communications Officer in Computing and Information Systems Graduate Research Students (CIS-GReS) and as the *Co-President of the Sri Lankan Graduates’ Society (SLGS)*, University of Melbourne.
