# Introduction

If you are searching for this you might be checking the tyre pressure for the first time and trying to use your air pump for the first time. This article target the information related to this operation. Most of these information can be found in the manual (section 8-5)

# Recommended tire pressure

| Type | Size | Pressure | Remarks |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Standard (Stingray) | 155/65R14 75S | 280 kPa (around 40 psi) | In manual it recommends tyre pressure of 41.6 Psi. This is mainly targeting the highways in Japan. However in Sri Lanka we face lot of rough road conditions and higher temperatures. So it is good to keep the tyre pressure **around 35 Psi.** |
| Standard | 165/55R15 75V | 240 kPa (around 35 psi) | In manual it recommends tyre pressure of 35 Psi. This is mainly targeting the highways in Japan. However in Sri Lanka we face lot of rough road conditions and higher temperatures. So it is good to keep the tyre pressure **around 30 Psi.** |
