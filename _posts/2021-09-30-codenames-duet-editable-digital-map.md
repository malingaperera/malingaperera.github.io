_**Codenames Duet**_ keeps the basic elements of _Codenames_ — give one-word clues to try to get someone to identify your agents among those on the table — but now you're working together as a team to find all of your agents. (Why you don't already know who your agents are is a question that Congressional investigators will get on your back about later!) - [BoardGamesGeek](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/224037/codenames-duet)

I found it easy to have a digital map when you are playing an online version (ex: https://codenames.game/). This map can keep your status (editable).

**How to use:** Each mission has two parameters. The first number is the total number of turns. When setting up a mission, put this many tokens in the time bank and leave the rest in the box. Moscow uses only 8, while Berlin uses all 11. Cairo uses 9, just like the standard Prague mission. The second number is the number of acceptable mistakes. Only this many tokens are bystander side up. - _Rule Book_
