The Sri Lankan Graduates' Society (SLGS) is a postgraduate society affiliated with the Graduate Student Association (GSA) at the University of Melbourne, Australia. We aim to advocate for the welfare of Sri Lankan graduate students and promote our culture and heritage among the multicultural community of the University, whilst also being committed to supporting undergraduate students in Sri Lanka. As part of our ongoing initiatives, we have strived to continue an annual scholarship program through which we award Sri Lankan undergraduate students a monthly scholarship for a period of one year. The main objective of this program is to financially assist and encourage students to achieve their academic goals.

Over the years we have been able to raise sponsorships for more than 10 students which we can assure were of great support to the recipients. You can read the testimonials of the recent scholarship recipients in the flyer attached below and on our [website](https://www.slgs.com.au/academic-scholarships-by-the-slgs/). The recipients of the scholarships are selected based on their financial needs as well as their outstanding academic performance at the university. In 2021, the SLGS provided two scholarships worth LKR 120,000/-. Considering the multitude of applications we receive each year, we hope we can expand the number of scholarships provided under this program with your support. 

We are kindly inviting you to join hands with the SLGS on this great cause to brighten the future of talented young individuals in Sri Lanka. We hope this program would offer you the great joy and satisfaction of being able to give back to our motherland. You can support us by selecting one of the following support packages.

- Support a student for a year **AUD 400**
- Support a student for 6 months **AUD 200**
- Support a student for 3 months **AUD 100**
